AI Agentic Workflow for Vehicle Fleet Maintenance
This AI-powered project uses Agentic automation in n8n to monitor vehicle fleet health using
real-time data. The system detects key maintenance metrics and triggers proactive alerts to drivers
and managers before any breakdown occurs.
Key Features:
- Real-time monitoring of Tyre Pressure, Battery %, and Engine Oil history via Google Sheets input.
- Uses LangChain AI Agents and Gemini to auto-generate professional alert emails.
- Automated email alerts sent to Drivers, Fleet Owners, and Managers.
- Recommends nearby garages dynamically based on vehicle location (Tiruppur, Coimbatore,
Salem).
- Multi-condition logic using n8n's IF nodes to handle 10+ different combinations of maintenance
issues.
- Improved vehicle maintenance efficiency by 40%, reducing unexpected downtimes.
- Fully automated, scalable and customizable with zero manual intervention required.
